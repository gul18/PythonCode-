#Handy datetime attributes:
dtnow.year, dtnow.month, dtnow.day, dtnow.hour, dtnow.minute, dtnow.second # get year, month, day, etc.from a datetime

#timedelta is a duration expressing the difference between two dates.

#date.today returns the current local date.

today > today-delta # compare dates
